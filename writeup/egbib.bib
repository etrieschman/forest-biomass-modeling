	abstract = {Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a prime forest parameter that requires global level estimates to study the global carbon cycle. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the state-of-the-art technology for AGB prediction but it is expensive, and its coverage is restricted to small areas. On the contrary, spaceborne Earth observation data are effective and economical information sources to estimate and monitor AGB at a large scale. In this paper, we present a study on the use of different spaceborne multispectral remote sensing data for the prediction of forest AGB. The objective is to evaluate the effects of temporal, spectral, and spatial capacities of multispectral satellite data for AGB prediction. The study was performed on multispectral data acquired by Sentinel-2, RapidEye, and Dove satellites which are characterized by different spatial resolutions, temporal availability, and number of spectral bands. A systematic process of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) variable selection generalized linear modeling, leave-one-out cross-validation, and analysis was accomplished on each satellite dataset for AGB prediction. Results point out that the multitemporal data based AGB models were more effective in prediction than the single-time models. In addition, red-edge and short wave infrared (SWIR) channel dependent variables showed significant improvement in the modeling results and contributed to more than 50% of the selected variables. Results also suggest that high spatial resolution plays a smaller role than spectral and temporal information in the prediction of AGB. The overall analysis emphasizes a good potential of spaceborne multispectral data for developing sophisticated methods for AGB prediction especially with specific spectral channels and temporal information.},

@article{Saarela_2020,
	abstract = {The increasing availability of remotely sensed data has recently challenged the traditional way of performing forest inventories, and induced an interest in model-based inference. Like traditional design-based inference, model-based inference allows for regional estimates of totals and means, but in addition for wall-to-wall mapping of forest characteristics. Recently Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based maps of forest attributes have been developed in many countries and been well received by users due to their accurate spatial representation of forest resources. However, the correspondence between such mapping and model-based inference is seldom appreciated. In this study we applied hierarchical model-based inference to produce aboveground biomass maps as well as maps of the corresponding prediction uncertainties with the same spatial resolution. Further, an estimator of mean biomass at regional level, and its uncertainty, was developed to demonstrate how mapping and regional level assessment can be combined within the framework of model-based inference.},

@article{Li_2020,
	abstract = {Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in the study of the carbon cycle and climate change in the global terrestrial ecosystem. AGB estimation based on remote sensing is an effective method for regional scale. In this study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-1A data and China's National Forest Continuous Inventory data in combination with three algorithms, either the linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), or the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to estimate biomass of the subtropical forests in Hunan Province, China. XGBoost is a scalable tree boosting system that is widely used by data scientists and provides state-of-the-art results for many problems. It can process an entire dataset with billions of examples using a minimal amount of computational resources through the particular way of cache access patterns, data compression, and data fragmentation. The results include: (1) The combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A images as predictor variables in the XGBoost model provided the best AGB estimation. (2) In contrast to the LR method, the F-test results indicated that a significant improvement in AGB estimation was achieved with the RF and XGBoost algorithms. (3) The effect of parameter optimization was found to be more significant on XGBoost than on RF. (4) The XGBoost model is an effective method for AGB estimation and can reduce the problems of overestimation and underestimation. This research provides a new way of estimating AGB for the subtropical forest based on remote sensing through the synergy of different sensors datasets and modeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {Biomass maps are valuable tools for estimating forest carbon and forest planning. Individual-tree biomass estimates made using allometric equations are the foundation for these maps, yet the potentially-high uncertainty and bias associated with individual-tree estimates is commonly ignored in biomass map error. We developed allometric equations for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in northern Colorado. Plot-level biomass estimates were combined with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM). Total biomass map uncertainty was calculated by propagating errors from allometric equations and remote sensing model predictions. Two evaluation methods for the allometric equations were compared in the error propagation---errors calculated from the equation fit (equation-derived) and errors from an independent dataset of destructively-sampled trees (n = 285).},

	abstract = {Quantitatively mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is of great significance for the study of terrestrial carbon storage and global carbon cycles, and remote sensing-based data are a valuable source of estimating forest AGB. In this study, we evaluated the potential of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) by integrating Gaofen-1 (GF1) images, Sentinel-1 (S1) images, and topographic data for AGB estimation in the Dabie Mountain region, China. Variables extracted from GF1 and S1 images and digital elevation model data from sample plots were used to explain the field AGB value variations. The prediction capability of stepwise multiple regression and three MLAs, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and backpropagation neural network were compared. The results showed that the RF model achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 16.26 t/ha), followed by the SVM model (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 18.03 t/ha) for the testing datasets. Some variables extracted from the GF1 images (e.g., normalized differential vegetation index, band 1-blue, the mean texture feature of band 3-red with windows of 3 &times; 3), S1 images (e.g., vertical transmit-horizontal receive and vertical transmit-vertical receive backscatter coefficient), and altitude had strong correlations with field AGB values (p &lt; 0.01). Among the explanatory variables in MLAs, variables extracted from GF1 made a greater contribution to estimating forest AGB than those derived from S1 images. These results indicate the potential of the RF model for evaluating forest AGB by combining GF1 and S1, and that it could provide a reference for biomass estimation using multi-source images.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we automate tree species classification and mapping using field-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN). We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band &lsquo;Red-Green-Blue&rsquo; pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classification accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classifier is pixel-based rather than object based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points &gt; 5 m above the ground) and the classifier was applied to image pixels that were thus identified as tree crowns. By training a CNN classifier using field data and hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality, across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional layers, a CNN model classified the correct species of 713 individual trees from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging from 0.67&ndash;0.95 depending on species. The CNN classification model performance increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral CNN model captures the species composition changes across ~700 meters (1935 to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to a higher-elevation fir-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought, insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning classifiers to tree species identification from geospatial imagery and field training data.},
